      "title": "Why don't you propose this one marketplace?",
      "content": "We're sure that this service is super great, but we cannot include every marketplace that exists. But maybe if you are numerous enough to suggest this, we'll have a look one day or another!"

    "part3": {
      "title": "The price you showed was not right!",
      "content": "Even though we aim for real-time pricing updates, we are technically not able to do so at the moment; which is why you may notice inconsistencies between the prices we show and the effective prices in the marketplaces."

    "part4": {
      "title": "Are you related to this or that marketplace?",
      "content": "No, we're not, LionSkins is independent. However, the Bitskins and Skinbaron links are affiliated, and we receive a commission if you buy on these marketplaces after using one of our links."
